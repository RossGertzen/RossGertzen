### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am currently looking for a Full-Time Data Science position in a collaborative environment working on meaningful, complex problems.

I would love to collaborate on any climate or environmental data analysis and predictive modelling. I have been looking to build skills in these areas and am passionate about learning to analyze the climate crisis.
